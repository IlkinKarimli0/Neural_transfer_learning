# Neural Transfer Project

This is a deep learning project that uses neural transfer to generate a new image by combining the content of one image with the style of another. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook file (neural_transfer.ipynb) that you can run locally or on Google Colab.

# How to Use
To run the notebook, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
TensorFlow 2
NumPy
Matplotlib
imageio


You can then open the 'neural_transfer.ipynb' file in Jupyter or Colab and run each cell in sequence. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations of the code and the neural transfer algorithm.

To generate a new image, you will need to provide a content image and a style image. You can do this by changing the paths to the images in the content_path and style_path variables. You can also adjust the hyperparameters of the algorithm, such as the weight of the content and style losses, the number of iterations, and the learning rate.

After running the notebook, the generated image will be saved to disk and displayed in the output cell.

# How It Works
The neural transfer algorithm is based on the work of Gatys et al. (2015), who introduced a method for separating and recombining the content and style information of images using deep neural networks. The algorithm works by defining a loss function that measures the difference between the feature representations of the content and style images in a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The loss function is then minimized using gradient descent to synthesize a new image that matches the content and style of the input images.
